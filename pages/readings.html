                    <h1>As We May Think</h1> 
                
                    <p>Reading the Introductory paragraph and realizing that the future device described is already in our hands, made me think about how far we are going with technology, and how much further we can go. Dr. Vannevar Bush, a leading expert in science applied to warfare, in his article called “As We May Think”, urges the scientific community to make knowledge more accessible during the process of innovation.<span class="dots">..</span>
                    <span class="more" style="display: none;">
                    <br><br>
                    Looking at the time the article was published, in 1945, during world war II, puts his thoughts and concerns about the effect of war on scientific achievements into perspective. How war brought scientists together in the common quest to find solutions to turn enemies away, arose the question of what might motivate scientist of certain fields together to share their knowledge? 
                    <br><br>
                    In the first section of his article, Dr. Bush discusses the lasting improvement in human’s lifestyle thanks to the cumulative human discoveries over history, he also highlights the increasing difficulty in grasping this huge amount of knowledge which gave birth to specialization, on this note, the most important issue for him is the availability and usability of the summation of human experience.“one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes later. Even the modern great library is not generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few”, Dr. Bush elaborates. 
                    <br><br>
                    In his article, much ahead of his time, Dr. Bush describes functions that we perform within our phones and computer devices in high detail, he called the machine a memex, he even predicted the process of recording information in what seems to describe blogs, and obtaining information much like we do in our current day while conducting research. He confidently calls his insight a prophecy of the known as having substance, because he ignored the technical difficulties to his predictions at his on the bases of the acceleration of technical progresses which will make this technology possible. </span></p>

                    <h1>Wizards, Bureaucrats, Warriors and Hackers: Writing the History of the Internet</h1>

                    <p>This article by Roy Rosenzweig discusses the History of the establishment of the Internet predecessors from different perspectives through analyzing different historical sources, from a contextualized social and cultural history angle, providing the bigger picture of the creation of the internet, while considering both, the internet in the closed world of the Cold War, and the decentralized open source internet based on the hackers ethics.<span class="dots">..</span>
                    <span class="more" style="display: none;"> 
                    <br><br>
                    Roy starts off with the contextualist book Where Wizards Stay Up late: The Origins of the Internet by Katie Hefner and Matthew Lyon, which infers the “creation” of the NET to the Advanced Research Projects Agency’s ARPANET in a biographic, great man model, even though the core technology of the internet was set long before by Paul Baran, in 1967, as a solution to overcome the loss of communication in the case of a nuclear threat. Roy clarifies that Hefner and Lyon de-emphasize the social and political contexts in which the NET was built, downplaying the military origins of the internet, by stating that the real embodiment of the internet as we know it today (intended to link computers so that researches can share resources) was the ARPANET, developed by Bob Taylor, Larry Roberts, Wes Clark and Frank Heart of the computer consulting company Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN).  
                    <br><br>
                    Like Hefner and Lyon’s book, Transforming Computer Technology: Information Processing for the Pentagon, 1962-1986 by Arthur L. Norberg and Judy E. O’Neill discusses the emergence of the Net. The more bureaucratic angle, however, is what makes Roy consider Norberg and O’Neill’s book a more lively read, through considering the close connection of the funding of all ARPA research to solving problems that are of interest to the department of defence. So regardless of Taylor’s idea stemming from the need to share resources, the funding that came from interest to improve military command and control, was what made the ARPANET successful, in addition, The emergence of additional networks made “inter-networking” to connect satellite net, radio net and ARPANET to communicate uniformly a military driven concern, which gave birth to the Internet in name and concept.
                    <br><br>
                    On the other Hand, while Paul Edwards’s The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America shares many topics and Sources with the above-mentioned sources, it draws a different path from the linear progression of technology resulting from the cold war described in Hefner and Lyon, and Norberg and O’Neill’s books. Edward’s considers the technological developments to have shaped the Cold War’s atmosphere just as much as the Cold War shaped computer technology, Roy supports this idea with the fact that computer development in the pre-Cold War times were funded with the knowledge of a guaranteed military market. According to Edwards, Practical military objectives guided the technological development down particular channels, increased its speed, and helped shape the structure of the emerging computer industry. 
                    <br><br>
                    The Last two main resources Roy discusses are Michael and Ronda Hauben’s Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet, and Steve Levy’s Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, because of their bottom up approach that focuses on the users effect on the development of the internet, taking a socio-cultural angle that suggests that the open world discourse of the antiwar movement and the counterculture of hackers which is based on the hackers ethics of making everything open source and accessible to the public. The Internet of the 1990s may be the perfect synthesis of the anti-hierarchical cultural revolution of the 1960s and the anti-statist revolution of the 1980s, Roy says.
                    <br><br>
                    In conclusion, in order to understand the development of the internet through history, we must consider all the complex aspects that played their role in shaping the internet as we know it today.</span>

                <div class="card" data-city="Leveling">
                    <h1>The Virtual Revolution: The Great Leveling?</h1>
                
                    <p>This documentary by Dr. Aleks Krotoski discusses the rise of the web, and the way it is able to give us equal access to resources, creating the ultimate empowering tool to people, with the online ideology that wants to give power to people. The documentary also explores the way this dynamic shifted over the years from the web being created as the true open source, and the re-establishment of hierarchies that was created<span class="dots">...</span>
                        <span class="more" style="display: none;"> within the web with those with more resources imposing their authority and taking advantage of the web as a platform to buy an sell rather than share.
                    <br><br>
                    Dr. Krotoski begins her exploration going back into the roots of the culture of free will and self expression tracing back to the 1960’s. 60 years ago, the epicentre of the counterculture was in San Fransisco, which was home to the new internet in the 1970’s. Online communities such as The Well developed early in 1985, which took the libertarian movement online. Activists such as John Perry Barlow of the Grateful Dead took part in the Cyberspace movement, challenging traditional authority. 
                    <br><br>
                    A very interesting part of the interview to me was what Barlow said in his interview with Krotoski, when he says that setting information free, sets people free, and that you don’t need to control people if you can control their access to information. This sort of control is clearly visible in developing countries, with wars induced limiting peoples access to proper education. Many resources are blocked, and religious waves are sponsored by governments to shift peoples attention from gaining the freedom that comes with access to knowledge. Educational infrastructures are continuously targeted by terrorism, and the world just seems to be moving backwards with more restrictions on access to softwares due to copyright issues that are not being resolved by governments. The web however, and peoples curiosity driving them to find ways to access internationally shared resources, is allowing the same fundamental shifts in the political landscape every where in the world. 
                    <br><br>
                    Dr. Krotoski then moves on to talk about the beneficial uses of the internet  worldwide, and how these outcomes are only achieved thanks to the creator of the world wide web, Tim Berners Lee making the web free and an open source to everyone. The next shift in the dynamic of the web is then explored with the template upon which the web had to be created, and that is the personal computer. Bill Gates developed Basic, the first programming language for the first personal computer called Altair 8800, he was also the first to exploit the web for business. 
                    <br><br>
                    Another shift was seen with the creation of Napster by Shawn Fanning, which allowed sharing music illegally for free. Napster was shut down in 2001 only to be replaced with more sophisticated alternatives like YouTube. Over time, the levelling dream offered by the web was starting to get compromised with more influential sources being controlled by editors, filtering the voices of people and thus re-establishing the old hierarchies, an example to that which Dr. Krotoski shares is Arianna Huffington’s Huffington Post, which claims to celebrate the democratizing power of the web, even though their own practices are an example of taming the webs voices. 
                    <br><br>
                    The web was born as a space without rules. Tim Berners Lee created it without a clear vision of what to do with it, and gave people the liberty to find ways to use it. Over time the web seems to have mirrored the dynamic of the real world authority models, but overtime keeps breaking out to seek more freedom for everyone.</span>

                    <h1>Is Google Making Us Stupid?</h1>

                    <p>This article by Nicholas Carr was a relief to read, because it made me know the reason for my decreasing attention span, and inability to read and even think the way I did before. This Article discusses the effect of the development of search engines that allow people to access more and more information at a rapidly increasing speed and accuracy, changing the way humans think.
                    <br><br>
                    While Carr might be pessimistic about our inability to engage in deep<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"> reading due to the current technologies that allow us to retrieve any kind of information almost instantaneously, I think that we are just in a transitional stage where the human brain is overwhelmed by the amount of information we have access to. Overtime, tools will develop to help humans in consuming and using this information differently. In his article, Carr discusses our brains ability to adapt at a biological level, in addition to the developing of an ultimate AI powered search engine that is as smart as people or even smarter, and expresses his concern of such technology replacing our brains, and says that It suggests a belief that intelligence is the output of a mechanical process, a series of discrete steps that can be isolated, measured, and optimized.
                    <br><br>
                    This article shares a skeptic outlook at the technological development of search engines and day to day applications, as inducing more distractions to our daily activities leading to a decreased ability to engage in deep thinking, and how it is in companies economic interest to drive us to distraction, but also considers the possibility of overcoming those technical challenges.</span>

                    <h1>The GNU Manifesto &  Everything is a Remix Remastered</h1>
                    
                    <p>The GNU Manifesto by Richard Stallman is part of the Free Software Movement, in it he invites contributions to be made to put together a sufficient body of free software which led to the family of operating systems known as linux.
                    <br><br>
                    In the Gnu Manifesto, Stallman condemns the way software sellers make users sign agreements to not share the software with others, he considers sharing to be the fundamental act of friendship among programmers.<span class="dots">..</span>
                    <span class="more" style="display: none;">  Stallman created GNU to serve as an example to inspire and a banner to rally others to join in sharing, in this way, efforts can go into advancing existing programs instead of the wasteful duplication of system programs. 
                    <br><br>
                    In Everything is a Remix Remastered, we learn that the basic elements of creativity are to copy, to transform, and to combine, that creativity being a product of genius to break the mold is just a myth, and that we need copying to learn and to build a foundation of knowledge, then transforming an original idea and combining different knowledge is what yields something new and what is regarded as creative. The concept of copying, transforming and combining applies to the most basic foundation of our existence: evolution. 
                    <br><br>
                    The GNU Manifesto, and Everything is a Remix, both discuss the destructive effects of the growing dominance of the market economy where intellectual labor is being bought and sold, limiting users access to learn in order to improve upon existing knowledge. According to Stallman, copying to a programmer is as natural as breathing, and as productive, which is why it ought to be free for the greater good. In Everything is a Remix, it is argued that we can’t introduce anything new until we’re fluent in the language of our domain, and we do that through emulation. 
                    <br><br>
                    Both sources conclude that making knowledge available for free to everyone will increase the wealth of humanity.</span>

                    <h1>The Yes Men Fix the World & Ad Busters-Culture Jamming</h1>   
                    
                    <p>While the Yes Men activist group claim to attempt to fix the world through culture jamming, I believe that they misused satire to increase awareness regarding the serious disasters they targeted. While they may have shown some of the impacted people supporting them in showing what the right thing to do would have been like, but the false announcements they made must have brought a great disappointment to at least some of those who did <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;">  believe justice was going to take place, and I believe they must have been selective in showing the impact of their activities on the people affected in their own favour. I personally find it difficult to believe that their actions were as celebrated as they showed them to be in the documentary by the people who were impacted in all cases, and I’m not sure how much better they were than the enterprises they targeted by using methods that ultimately didn’t benefit the people affected and rather rubbing salt in their wounds, after all, people facing disaster aren’t in a humorous position to simply get over such disappointment and injustice, and in the end of the day, they didn't succeed to make the target enterprises make things right, which ultimately didn’t “fix the world”, so the method they used to bring awareness regarding those disasters was to say the least inconsiderate. I could see how culture jamming can be an effective way to get attention and raise awareness on certain subjects, but I just believe that when peoples traumas are involved it is a very delicate matter and that it should be handled with more mindfulness. 
                    <br><br>
                    For the second video with Ad Busters-Culture Jamming aimed at American Consumerism, I find it interesting that this old video from 1997 is still relevant to this day in the west, with the media continuously creating  insecurity in consumers to sell them more “solutions”, but I doubt that vulgar ads counteracting these trends are an effective solution.</span>
